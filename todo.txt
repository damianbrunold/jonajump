- add moving items (up-down, left-right, jumping)
- jumping on moving item should remove it
- add item with coin inside, by bumping from below the coin can be collected
- animate the player

- move acceleration, decay, velocity stuff to the items, this
  enables icy bricks, or tar bricks, varying the jump height
  and so on.
  
- add doors to go from one place to another
- add bricks that can be stood on but jumped through

- add unit tests for hit detection and motion handling

- add sound effects, jump (optional?), collect drop, gold and star

- limit number of stars to one per level
- think about what to do with drops and gold coins
- calculate an overall score (some formula containing drops, gold and stars)

- design very complex level to see how far the rendering goes

- maybe use simple color in bricks if it is faster than textures
- cache textures

- add spring brick that allows very high/far jump
- add paraglider item that allows flying around for some time
