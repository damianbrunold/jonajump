- create a sprite class with basic move, display and hit-detection capability
- create player sprite class with jumping, falling etc
- add hit-detection
- instead of only solid state elements, split it into three variants:
  - solid
  - step (one can jump up through it, but stand on it)
  - trapdoor (one falls through it, but cannot jump up again
